# Daily-Motivation
 
 ## Description
 I've recently read a lot of self help books and from time to time I come across a quote that I fall in love with. In an attempt to not forget these quotes, I stored them in a MySQL database and created an application that sends one of these quotes out via SMS every day.   
 
 Some of these quotes include:
 
 * "A full life will be full of pain.  But the only alternative is not to live fully or not to live at all."
 * "We are often most in the dark when we are the most certain, and the most enlightened when we are  the most confused."
 * "What does a life of total dedication to truth mean?  It means, first of all, a life of continuous and never-ending stringent self-examination."
